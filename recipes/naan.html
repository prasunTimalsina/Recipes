    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is an authentic Indian naan recipe that's broiled instead of
      pan-fried. I have made it many times. It goes well with Indian curry
      dishes that have a lot of gravy, such as butter chicken.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredient">
      <li>⅔ cup warm water (110°F/45°C)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
      <li>¼ cup ghee</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kalonji (onion seed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to follow</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        Whisk warm water with yeast and sugar until yeast is dissolved. Cover
        and let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Add yeast mixture, yogurt, and half of the ghee to the flour. Mix into a
        soft dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic (about 5
        minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm
        place for 1.5 hours or until doubled in volume.
      </li>
      <li>Punch down the dough and knead for another 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Divide the dough into six equal pieces.</li>
      <li>Roll each piece out into 8-inch rounds.</li>
      <li>
        Cover an oven tray with foil, grease it, and brush the dough rounds with
        the remaining ghee.
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle kalonji (onion seed) on top.</li>
      <li>
        Cook each round under the broiler until puffed and lightly browned
        (about 2 minutes per side).
      </li>
    </ol>
